# Project Overview

## Motivation

This project was created as a long-term learning and experimentation
platform focused on physics simulation, mathematics, and modern C++
software engineering.

The author has a strong background in software development and wants to
use this project to deepen practical knowledge in:

- Modern C++ design and tooling
- Numerical methods and physics simulation
- Concurrency and parallel computing
- Performance-oriented and data-oriented design
- Engine-style architecture and scalability

## Learning-Oriented Design

This is intentionally a hobby and free-time project. Design decisions
prioritize:

- Clarity over premature optimization
- Incremental complexity
- Replaceability of components
- Strong tooling and observability

The project is expected to evolve over time as understanding deepens.

## Long-Term Vision

In the long term, the project aims to evolve toward a production-quality,
industry-grade simulation engine, without sacrificing its role as an
experimentation and learning environment.
