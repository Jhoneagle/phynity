# Matrices

This module will contain matrix implementations for linear transformations.

## Planned Classes

- **Mat2** - 2×2 matrix for 2D transformations
- **Mat3** - 3×3 matrix for 2D homogeneous coordinates and 3D rotations
- **Mat4** - 4×4 matrix for 3D transformations (the most commonly used)
- **MatN<M, N>** - Template-based MxN matrices for general linear algebra
- **MatDynamic** - Runtime-sized matrices

## Operations

- Basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication (matrices and vectors)
- Determinant, inverse, transpose
- Decompositions: QR, LU, SVD
- Conversions to/from quaternions and Euler angles

## Status

Coming soon...
